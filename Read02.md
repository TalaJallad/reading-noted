# Text Editors and The Terminal

## 1. Text Editors

Text editors are softwared used to write the code for the web page you want to create. There are several types of these editors. 

### 1.2. Types of Editors
1- Pre-intalled editors on you computer
Examples of these are Notepad on Windows and Text Edit on Mac. 
2- Third party text editors:
These are softwares that you need to install on your comouter. Some examples are: Sublime Text, Brackets, Visual Studio Code, and BB Edit. 

### 1.3 The Difference bwtween Text Editor Types
Preinstalled editor lack many features that third part ones have. Such as, syntax highlighting, extensions, ability to store code files and folders
within the software,code completion, easily connect and use 2 codes like HTML and CSS, among many other fearure. 
Not having these features would make a developer's work a lot more tedious and take a long time. That's why large numbers of editors resort to the latter option. 

### 1.4 Choosing the Suitable Text Editor
As mentioned earlier, text editors have different features. That is why a developer should be careful about the editor he/she choosed depending on his/her needs. 
For instance, the top three feature that are recommended to have in your text edior are extensions, code completion and syntax highlighting. Each of these will
make your coding process  quicker, smoother and more enjoybale to be honest. For instance some softwares don't have a live server feature, so before installing
any software create a list of the features that you need in your editor and download a text editor accordingly. 
 
 ## 2. The Terminal
 
 This is a cheat sheet for the command lines.
 
 Command | Function
 ------- | --------
 pwd | tell us where we are 
 ls | sHow  the content of our location
 ls -l | do a long listing
 ls /etc | list directory content
 ~ | a shortcut for the home directory
 ../../ | list the parent directory
 cd [location] | change directory
 ls -a | lists hidden files
 
 
 
 
 
 ### NOTES:
 * Types of paths: Absulute and Relative
 -Absulute: it specifies a location in relation to the root directory and is prompted using *pwd*. The outcome: /home/tala
 -Relative: it specifies a location in relation to where we currenlty are can can be prompted using *ls + directory name*
 *ls can be ran wiht an absulute path too. Example: ls /home/tala/directoryname*
 * Files are arranged in the form of a hiararchy with the **root** directory on the top.
 -instead of writing *ls/home/tala/directoryname*, we can write it as *~/directoryname*
 -To learn the type of file use this command: file [path]. Example: file Documents/text1.0 *this will tell us the file type for text1.0*
 - The command line is made up of the command and its arguments. And we should leave a space between them. If we have file name with a space beteween its words,
 we should put it in single quotation so the terminal don't mistake the name for 2 arguments. Example: cd my books *wrong* | cd 'my books' *correct* or we can use
 an escape charachter (\) after *my* as in: cd my\ books.
