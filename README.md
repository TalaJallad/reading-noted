   ## Who am I?
   I am a passionate person who strives to give 100% in everything she does.
   And as someone who enjoys a good challenge, I consider the ASAC software development course a true blessing!
     
   ## What is this about? 
   
   It is a daily documentation of my tinme as a student in the aforementioned course. I will be writing about my successes, failings and most importantly, my learnings. It is a      way for me to look back on my progress and see how far I have come and how much I have changed as a person. I hope you enjoy it!

   Today was a very intensive to say the least. And to be hones, I don't think I have ever been overwhelmed as I was today. A huge part of my frsutration today can be attributed to the fact that, during the installation part, my windows did me wrong and took about 6 hours to update!! Of course near the end my laptop's battery ran out and the installation data was lost! and this when I lost it! However, one thing kept going till this moment and that is someting our instructor @thamudi talked about and that is **The Growth Mindset!**
