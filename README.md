### My Day
*13/12/2020*

Today was  very intensive to say the least. And to be hones, I don't think I have ever been overwhelmed as I was today. A huge part of my frsutration today can be attributed to the fact that, during the installation part, my windows did me wrong and took about 6 hours to update!! Of course near the end my laptop's battery ran out and the installation data was lost! and this when I lost it! However, one thing kept going till this moment and that is someting our instructor [@thamudi](https://github.com/thamudi) talked about and that is **The Growth Mindset!** I will explain it for you below!

* *The Growth Mindset* 

* First of all, let's explain what a **"mindset"** is: It is the way you perceive things in the world around you; how you feel and think about things. 
* The Second thing you need to know is that we have **2 types** of mindsets:

**Fixed Mindset** | **Growth Mindset**
-------------   | --------------
Dislikes challenges | Embraces challenges 
Failings means he/she are incompetent | Sees failings as learning opportunites 
Lazy and a quitter | Hard worker and resilient 
Doesn't care for criticism | Welcomes criticism and uses it to grow
Threatened by succssesful people | Inspired by successful people

- How to acquire a growth mindset:

We all had the fixed mindset at a certain point in our lives, and maybe some of us currently has have it, so what should we do? 
We need to utilize ways that enable us to shift to a growth mindset. One of the best ways to this is through being self awaren. That means you need to always question yourself, review your actions and decisions and ask for feedback. One great habit you can adopt is that at end of each day, you take some time to reflect on your highlights and lows, your achievements and failings and figure out how to prevent the same failures or lows in the future.

***The follwing are the things that I will do daily to acquire a growth a mindset:***  

-Create a to do list that includes the goals i Want to achieve in each day

-When I face an obstacle, I will focus on sloving it instead of feeling down

-I will reflect on my day by asking myself these questions: Did you achieve your all your goals for the day? What obstacles did you face? how did you overcome                     them? how can you prevent them in the future? What are the highlights of your day? 


* The End:

Just like that we have rached the end of my day. It was eye-opening in many ways and I look forward to the coming days, to new stories and learning, and to watching my self grow professionally and personally!
