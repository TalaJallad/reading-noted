   ## Who am I?
   I am a passionate person who strives to give 100% in everything she does.
   And as someone who enjoys a good challenge, I consider the ASAC software development course a true blessing!
     
   ## What is this about? 
   
   It is a daily documentation of my tinme as a student in the aforementioned course. I will be writing about my successes, failings and most importantly, my learnings. It is a      way for me to look back on my progress and see how far I have come and how much I have changed as a person. I hope you enjoy it!

        **Growth Mindset** | **Fixed Mindset**

        Sees failings as learning opportunites |  Failings means he/she are incompetent
        Hard worker and resilient | Lazy and a quitter
