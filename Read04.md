#Structure web pages with HTML
## What I learned:
1. I learned how to structure HTML codes.

2. We must always start an html code with this tag: <html> ..... </html>

3. We write in the <body>...</body> anything that we want the borwser to view to the user.

4. When disigning my webiste I need to think about the people that will visit it. What are their goals and how can the website fulfill it. I need to think How I can create attractive content to keep the visitors motivated. 

I must sort the pages and information in website in a way that makes it easy for visitors to view and find content. 

I learned about wireframes and how they can be a great way to sort and plan my ideas. 

The navigation bar must be concise, clear, selective, interactive, provide context, and consistent. 

I learned about semantic elemnts in html and how they should be orgnised: /<nav></nav>, <header></header>, <main></main>, <footer></footer>. There are more of course but these are the most prominent ones.
