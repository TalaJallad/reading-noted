#Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

##What I learned:
* *b* between angle brackets makes text bold
* *i* makes text italic
* *hr* creates a break between text with a line
* *del* adds a line through the word
* *ins* underlines the word
* *s* add line through the centre of the word
* HTML elements describe the structure of the content and provide semantic information using the semantic elements
