### 1.1 What is Markdown?
It is a light weight markup languaage. This means it renders text into the browser with some design features. 
### 1.2 What is it used for?
* It is used for generating HTML files because it lighter than MS Word or Google Docs for instance.
* It is used for writing instruction manuals for progrmas. i.e. documentation.
### 1.3 How do we name  Markdown files?
We dan add any name to the file followed by the extension **.md** It is preferred to name HTML file in GitHub as README.md or index.md so it is redered into the web page automatically. 
### 1.4 How to use Markdown?
It is a very simple tool; writing in it is similar to writing in a normal notebook. The only difference is that when you want to design your text, you will need to use special symbols. Here are the most basic ones: 

Symbol | Function
----------- | --------
** ** | Bold
\* \* | Italics
\- | Bullet point for unordered lists
\*** \*** | All text is in bold and italics
\~ \~ | Strike through          


* To add an image, you can use the following code: \![image description] (image link)

* To link a text, you can use this code: \[text to be linked] (link)

*You can find more codes [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).*
